    WHOIS is now taking submissions of pitches, papers, projects and research for its inaugural issue in response to the theme firsts. <br> </br>

As a consequence of being online, we are subjected to an infinite series of firsts. When only so much can be consumed, everything we see on the internet competes for first. Update cycles and algorithms promote novelty and competitiveness, sorting content based on what should be first, and thus making it so. Being a technology of adaptation, the web is constantly being remade and reimagined by its users, making firsts common place. When an “original” source gets obscured by its maniacal reproduction, what happens to the significance of its first iteration? What we see in subsequent manipulations might be considered numerous firsts of their own. <br> </br>

Firsts can be exciting but they can also be exhausting and unproductive. We are interested in the ways users repurpose the web for good for bad and for fun. For those of us “born digital” and those who endured the struggle and excitements of learning the web we are asking you to reflect on any instances of internet firsts, whatever that means to you.<br> </br>

Send us your ideas for interviews, reviews, essays, fiction or art projects; or send us completed but unpublished work. We can pay $50-$100 depending on length and scope of the piece. Send pitches to  <a href="mailto:whois.submit@gmail.com">whois.submit@gmail.com. </a><br> <br>Take a look at our <!-- <span class="prompts">  -->Prompts <!-- </span>  -->and Links for projects, events and texts that got us thinking about firsts. <br> </br>

          Tell us about a platform's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-egg-experimental-new-app-personalized-webpages-nostalgia-2020-11"  target="_blank">evolution</a>, or how an application’s function has been <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html  target="_blank">repurposed</a>. What were the unique outcomes of this change? Did it bring users together in new ways? Tell us about a glitch, an uncaught error or a side effect that <a href=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/seafloor-cables-carry-world-s-internet-traffic-can-also-detect-earthquakes  target="_blank">changed somethings function</a> or the way we understood it. Explore an instance when the internet resurfaced something from the past, making it new again. Think about a formative experience you had with or on the web. Follow a lead about the first person or community who did something differently. Following the <a href="https://en.unesco.org/themes/information-preservation/digital-heritage/concept-digital-heritage"  target="_blank">UNESCO Digital Heritage</a> project, tell us about an internet artifact you deem worthy of preservation. We want your incisive, interesting and honest reflections on the ambivalence of the internet. <br><br> <br>

 <div class="hover-on-1 box" id="text1"> The city, as the noted urban sociologist Robert Park once wrote, is: “man’s most consistent and on the whole, his most successful attempt to remake the world he lives in more after his heart’s desire. But, if the city is the world which man created, it is the world in which he is henceforth condemned to live. Thus, indirectly, and without any clear sense of the nature of his task, in making the city man has remade himself.”</div>
