  The web is a place that we make and that remakes us&mdash;with every adaptation on the internet, we too are changed. WHOIS wants to explore the web's territory as a place that can and should be made to suit our own <span class="heartsdesire">heart’s desire</span>. We also wish to explore the ways in which the web becomes a place of constraint, of familiar dynamics, of bad options. Despite the web’s emancipatory potential, the ability to be anonymous online has yet to free us from the entrenched hierarchies of power that inform contemporary society. Instead, we have seen technocapitalism accelerated, paralleling and informing real life in terrifying ways. And so, as we wander through the unfamiliar online, we also return to the well-known.  <br> </br>

With each issue, WHOIS will highlight critical, tender and generative responses to our world on the web.  Calling upon all kinds of contributions, we’ll look to produce a diverse portrait of the online trails we stamp out--exposing the myths, telling the everyday stories, and sharing both the profound and the mundane experiences we have with a technology whose shifting forms and functions are both a response to and reflection of the people that shape it.

 <div class="hover-on-1 box" id="text1"> The city, as the noted urban sociologist Robert Park once wrote, is: “man’s most consistent and on the whole, his most successful attempt to remake the world he lives in more after his heart’s desire. But, if the city is the world which man created, it is the world in which he is henceforth condemned to live. Thus, indirectly, and without any clear sense of the nature of his task, in making the city man has remade himself.”</div>
